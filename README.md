# HLT-Project

Project for the Human Language Technologies course @ University of Pisa

##
The project was developed in association with *Compagnia Trasporti Toscana (CTT)*, which is the company that handles the public transportation in Tuscany. The focus of the project was to improve the document archiving process in compliance with the Protocollo Informatico Italian law. In fact, the user of public administration, in order to archive a protocol, has to fill various fields, in particular: needs to write a summary of the contents of the document (*Oggetto*), pick the correct document repository for the office (*Contenitore*) and then choose the correct class among many. The model will provide a *top 3/5 prediction* over the possible correct classes.

The analysis will cover models to handle *First and Second Level Classification*:
- **First Level Classification:** the documents can be classified in *15* possible classes.
- **Second Level Classification:** the documents can be classified in *118* possible classes.

In the report the following analysis can be found:
- *Dataset analysis*
- *First Level model*
- *Second Level model*
- *Test set results*
- *Comparison with Baselines*
